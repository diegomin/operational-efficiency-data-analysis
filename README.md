# Operational Efficiency Data Analysis
End-to-end data analysis project focused on operational efficiency and business insights.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes operational performance using a real-world dataset to identify inefficiencies, delays, and cost drivers. The goal is to transform raw data into actionable business insights.

## ❓ Business Question
How can we improve delivery efficiency and reduce operational costs without impacting service levels?

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- SQL (for exploratory queries)
- Power BI (dashboard visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key KPIs
- On-time delivery rate
- Average delivery time
- Average cost per order
- Orders per customer

## 🔍 Analysis Process
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. KPI calculation
5. Dashboard creation
6. Executive insights and recommendations

## 💡 Key Insights
- A small percentage of delayed orders accounts for a large share of operational costs.
- Delivery delays are strongly correlated with higher costs.
- A limited group of customers drives most of the order volume.

## 🚀 Recommendations
- Focus optimization efforts on deliveries exceeding 7 days.
- Monitor high-cost orders through automated alerts.
- Prioritize process improvements for high-volume customers.

## 📎 Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- Executive dashboard
- Actionable business recommendations
